# Waveforms-Sg132S-2A
## This was my master thesis project. The main purpose of the application was to show waveforms of currents and voltages in the Sg132S-2A motor, based on the user's input. 

### (ASP .NET, MVC).

Today I'd do a lot of things differently, but I still consider this as an important project in my developer carrier.

Below some screenshots from the project.
